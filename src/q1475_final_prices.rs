//You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of the iᵗʰ
//item in a shop.
//
// There is a special discount for items in the shop. If you buy the iᵗʰ item,
//then you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[j] where j is the minimum
//index such that j > i and prices[j] <= prices[i]. Otherwise, you will not
//receive any discount at all.
//
// Return an integer array answer where answer[i] is the final price you will
//pay for the iᵗʰ item of the shop, considering the special discount.
//
//
// Example 1:
//
//
//Input: prices = [8,4,6,2,3]
//Output: [4,2,4,2,3]
//Explanation:
//For item 0 with price[0]=8 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[1]
//=4, therefore, the final price you will pay is 8 - 4 = 4.
//For item 1 with price[1]=4 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[3]
//=2, therefore, the final price you will pay is 4 - 2 = 2.
//For item 2 with price[2]=6 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[3]
//=2, therefore, the final price you will pay is 6 - 2 = 4.
//For items 3 and 4 you will not receive any discount at all.
//
//
// Example 2:
//
//
//Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
//Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
//Explanation: In this case, for all items, you will not receive any discount
//at all.
//
//
// Example 3:
//
//
//Input: prices = [10,1,1,6]
//Output: [9,0,1,6]
//
//
//
// Constraints:
//
//
// 1 <= prices.length <= 500
// 1 <= prices[i] <= 1000
